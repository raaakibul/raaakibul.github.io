                    <p>
                        At present, I am employed by CareTutors which is the largest online and offline tutoring platform in Bangladesh and I teach and mentor high school and college students. I also provide face-to-face and collective classroom instruction in Physics, Mathematics, and Programming Languages including Python, C, C++, and JavaScript. By teaching, I have gained the ability to communicate effectively and learn to explain a complicated concept in a simple and practical manner so that my students would feel the desire to learn and understand.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am a Computer Science graduate of the University of Asia Pacific, who is highly interested in the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning to achieve real-life impact. My course work has assisted me in establishing strong knowledge base on computer science principles and my projects have given me the opportunity to practice these theories in solving significant problems. The theory and practical learning have formed my urge to continue learning and experimenting with the developed AI technologies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My research fields are in machine learning or Deep Learning-based human-computer interaction (HCI) systems. I am intrigued by the fact that smart systems have a way to comprehend, react to and even predict human behavior. I would like to ask how technology can be more humanized, accessible, and intuitive on the basis of machine learning models that would fill the gap between people and digital systems.

                <p class="more-about-me">
                    Beyond my academic interests, I'm an avid fan of Formula 1 (F1) racing. What draws me most to the sport is not just the speed and adrenaline, but the precision engineering, cutting-edge technology, and data-driven strategies that make every race a complex and dynamic competition.
                </p>
                <p class="more-about-me">
                    I closely follow the teams, drivers, and developments in aerodynamics, tire strategy, and power unit innovation. Watching how milliseconds and smart decisions can redefine an entire race reminds me of how attention to detail and intelligent problem-solving are also critical in my field of machine learning and AI.

                <p class="more-about-me">
                    "Formula 1 inspires me to think about performance optimization not only on the track but also in algorithms, systems, and human potential. It's a perfect fusion of passion, technology, and performance much like the kind of work I aspire to do in research and innovation."
