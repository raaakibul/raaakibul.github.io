        Hi there!! I'm Rakibul Islam. I work at the Largest online and offline based tutoring platform <a class="highlight" href="https://caretutors.com/">CareTutor</a> in Bangladesh. I Gave in-person lessons on physics, mathematics and programming Languages (Python, C, C++ and JavaScript) to high school and college level students.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Vision:</strong> I aim to become a research scientist at a prestigious university or research institution. I am particularly interested in combining academic research with industrial collaboration. I aspire to establish my lab to conduct cutting-edge research that advances science and benefits academia and industry. As a dedicated learner, I investigate the possible benefits of Artificial Intelligence technology to enhance human life. My research interest areas are including machine learning, deep learning and artificial intelligence in the design and implementation of research tools.  My primary purpose is to develop widely implementable machine and deep learning-based solutions for real scenarios in artificial technology. <b>I'm looking for fully funded graduate opportunity for the upcoming semester (fall or spring).</b>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Previously, I completed my Bachelor’s in <a class="highlight" href="https://cse.uap-bd.edu/">Computer Science</a> at <a class="highlight" href="https://www.uap-bd.edu/">University of Asia Pacific.</a> I was advised by <a href="https://cse.uap-bd.edu/faculties/faculty_details/11" class="highlight">Assistant Professor Tanjina Helaly.</a> My undergraduate thesis focused on Deep Learning-Based Background Noise Classification and Reduction for Audio Enhancement, supervised by <a class="highlight" href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=20fAehwAAAAJ&hl=en">Rashik Rahman.</a>

            <hr>
            <p>
                My name is Rakibul Islam. But I go by <b>Rakibul or Rakib</b>. I love sports (Cricket, Tennis, Nba Basketball, Football, Formula 1), reading research papers, books and watching movies. I enjoy following the Olympic Games, especially events like swimming, track and field, and other athletic competitions that showcase the power of human dedication and performance.
            </p>
            <p>
                 Beyond my academic interests, I’m an avid fan of Formula 1 (F1) racing. What draws me most to the sport is not just the speed and adrenaline, but the precision engineering, cutting-edge technology, and data-driven strategies that make every race a complex and dynamic competition.

                I closely follow the teams, drivers, and developments in aerodynamics, tire strategy, and power unit innovation. Watching how milliseconds and smart decisions can redefine an entire race reminds me of how attention to detail and intelligent problem-solving are also critical in my field of machine learning and AI.

                Formula 1 also inspires me to think about performance optimization not only on the track but also in algorithms, systems, and human potential. It’s a perfect fusion of passion, technology, and performance much like the kind of work I aspire to do in research and innovation.

                                    </div>
                                    <p>Beyond my academic interests, I'm an avid fan of Formula 1 (F1) racing. What draws me most to the sport is not just the speed and adrenaline, but the precision engineering, cutting-edge technology, and data-driven strategies that make every race a complex and dynamic competition.</p>
                                    <p>I closely follow the teams, drivers, and developments in aerodynamics, tire strategy, and power unit innovation. Watching how milliseconds and smart decisions can redefine an entire race reminds me of how attention to detail and intelligent problem-solving are also critical in my field of machine learning and AI.</p>
                                    <p>"Formula 1 inspires me to think about performance optimization not only on the track but also in algorithms, systems, and human potential. It's a perfect fusion of passion, technology, and performance much like the kind of work I aspire to do in research and innovation."</p>
