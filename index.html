            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
              Currently, I work at Bangladesh's largest online and offline
              tutoring platform CareTutors in Bangladesh. I Gave in-person and
              group lessons on physics, mathematics and programming Languages
              (Python, C, C++ and JavaScript) to high school and college level
              students.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am a dedicated Computer Science graduate from the University of
              Asia Pacific, passionate about the intersection of artificial
              intelligence, machine learning, and real-world applications. My
              academic journey has equipped me with a strong foundation in
              computer science principles and practical experience in developing
              innovative solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
              My research interests lie in Machine Learning and Deep
              Learning-based Human-Computer Interaction Systems. That can be
              implemented in real-world scenarios. I am particularly fascinated
              by the potential of AI to enhance human life and solve complex
              problems across various domains.

              My name is Rakibul Islam. But I go by Rakibul or Rakib. I love
              sports (Cricket, Tennis, NBA Basketball, Football, Formula 1),
              reading research papers, books and watching movies. I enjoy
              following the Olympic Games, especially events like swimming,
              track and field, and other athletic competitions that showcase the
              power of human dedication and performance.

                <p>
                  Beyond my academic interests, I'm an avid fan of Formula 1
                  (F1) racing. What draws me most to the sport is not just the
                  speed and adrenaline, but the precision engineering,
                  cutting-edge technology, and data-driven strategies that make
                  every race a complex and dynamic competition.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I closely follow the teams, drivers, and developments in
                  aerodynamics, tire strategy, and power unit innovation.
                  Watching how milliseconds and smart decisions can redefine an
                  entire race reminds me of how attention to detail and
                  intelligent problem-solving are also critical in my field of
                  machine learning and AI.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div class="f1-quote">
                "Formula 1 inspires me to think about performance optimization
                not only on the track but also in algorithms, systems, and human
                potential. It's a perfect fusion of passion, technology, and
                performance much like the kind of work I aspire to do in
                research and innovation."
