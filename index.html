            <h2>Welcome!</h2>
            <p>Hi there!! I'm Rakibul Islam. I work at the Largest online and offline based tutoring platform CareTutor in Bangladesh. I Gave in-person lessons on physics, mathematics and programming Languages (Python, C, C++ and JavaScript) to high school and college level students. 
                
            <br>
            <br>I aim to become a research scientist at a prestigious university or research institution. I am particularly interested in combining academic research with industrial collaboration. I aspire to establish my lab to conduct cutting-edge research that advances science and benefits academia and industry. As a dedicated learner, I investigate the possible benefits of Artificial Intelligence technology to enhance human life. My research interest areas are including machine learning, deep learning and artificial intelligence in the design and implementation of research tools.  My primary purpose is to develop widely implementable machine and deep learning-based solutions for real scenarios in artificial technology.
            <br>
            <br>
            Previously, I completed my Bachelorâ€™s in Computer Science at University of Asia Pacific. Where I was advised by Tanjina Helaly. I did my undergraduate thesis on Deep Learning-Based Background Noise Classification
            and Reduction for Audio Enhancement. where i was advised by Rashik Rahman.
            
            <br>
            <br>
            In this website, I write about Machine Learning and Open Source. Check out the Blog section!
