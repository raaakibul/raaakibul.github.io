                    <p>
                        Currently, I work at Bangladesh's largest online and offline tutoring platform CareTutors in Bangladesh. I Gave in-person and group lessons on physics, mathematics and programming Languages (Python, C, C++ and JavaScript) to high school and college level students.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am a dedicated Computer Science graduate from the University of Asia Pacific, passionate about the intersection of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and real-world applications. My academic journey has equipped me with a strong foundation in computer science principles and practical experience in developing innovative solutions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My research interests lie in Machine Learning and Deep Learning-based Human-Computer Interaction Systems. That can be implemented in real-world scenarios. I am particularly fascinated by the potential of AI to enhance human life and solve complex problems across various domains.

                <p class="more-about-me">
                    Beyond my academic interests, I'm an avid fan of Formula 1 (F1) racing. What draws me most to the sport is not just the speed and adrenaline, but the precision engineering, cutting-edge technology, and data-driven strategies that make every race a complex and dynamic competition.
                </p>
                <p class="more-about-me">
                    I closely follow the teams, drivers, and developments in aerodynamics, tire strategy, and power unit innovation. Watching how milliseconds and smart decisions can redefine an entire race reminds me of how attention to detail and intelligent problem-solving are also critical in my field of machine learning and AI.
                </p>
                <p class="more-about-me">
                    "Formula 1 inspires me to think about performance optimization not only on the track but also in algorithms, systems, and human potential. It's a perfect fusion of passion, technology, and performance much like the kind of work I aspire to do in research and innovation."
